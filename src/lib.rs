#![warn(clippy::all)]

//! Principals for AWS and AWS-like services.
//!
//! Principals come in two "flavors": actors and policies. A policy-based prinicpal can be completely specified via
//! an ARN in an Identity and Access Management (IAM) Aspen policy, e.g.,
//! `arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/Sales/Bob`. This is what most people think of when they refer to principals
//! when talking about AWS. In this example:
//! * The partition (cloud instance) is `aws` (the AWS commercial cloud);
//! * The AWS account in the partition is `123456789012`.
//! * This refers to an IAM user.
//! * The path to the user is `/Sales/`.
//! * The user name is `Bob`.
//!
//! On the service implementation side, however, there are additional details attached to a principal actor. Groups,
//! roles, and users have a
//! [universally unique ID](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_identifiers.html#identifiers-unique-ids).
//! If the `/Sales/Bob` user is deleted and another is created, these users will have the same ARN but different unique
//! IDs. While not part of the principal itself, this can be referred to in Aspen policies via the
//! [`\${aws:username}`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_variables.html) policy
//! variable. Assumed roles carry a token issue time, access via the `\${aws:TokenIssueTime}` variable, as well as
//! an expiration time on or after which the assumed role is no longer valid.
